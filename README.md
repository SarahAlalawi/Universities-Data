# Universities-Data
This dataset is useful because it gives us a historical look at university ranking and university income score. Income is an interesting variable because university rank doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the university has high income (for example, higher ranking universities can have the score of income less than 50). I used the DATE function to show the date in this format (MM/DD/YY). I used the pivot table and pivot chart to answer important business questions. Pivot table and pivot chart are useful tools to analyze data (i.e. find the answers to these questions and give meaningful results).
